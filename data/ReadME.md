# Brain Tumor MRI Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset, which is designed for the classification and analysis of brain tumors from MRI scans. The dataset is structured to support machine learning and computer vision applications, particularly in the medical imaging field.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes a collection of MRI images classified into various categories representing different types of brain tumors. It is suitable for training and validating models for the detection and classification of brain tumors.

The original files were converted from .dcm (dicom) files to .jpg files for greater interpretability. 

## Usage
The images in this dataset can be used to develop and test algorithms for medical diagnosis assistance. For usage, please refer to the specific licensing and citation requirements as detailed on the dataset's page on Kaggle.
