    "data/glioma/Te-gl_0014.jpg": " **Case 1**\n\n**Patient Name:** John Doe\n**Age:** 55\n**Sex:** Male\n\n**History:** The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes. He presents with a 2-week history of headaches and nausea.\n\n**Imaging Findings:** The MRI scan shows a large, round mass in the right frontal lobe of the brain. The mass is hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. There is surrounding edema and mass effect.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Brain tumor, likely glioma\n\n**Treatment:** The patient will undergo surgery to remove the tumor.\n\n**Prognosis:** The prognosis for this patient depends on the type of brain tumor and the extent of the surgery.\n\n**Case 2**\n\n**Patient Name:** Jane Doe\n**Age:** 45\n**Sex:** Female\n\n**History:** The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of breast cancer. She presents with a 3-month history of back pain and leg weakness.\n\n**Imaging Findings:** The MRI scan shows a large, lytic lesion in the L3 vertebra. There is surrounding edema and spinal cord compression.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Metastatic breast cancer\n\n**Treatment:** The patient will undergo radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\n\n**Prognosis:** The prognosis for this patient is poor.\n\n**Case 3**\n\n**Patient Name:** John Smith\n**Age:** 65\n**Sex:** Male\n\n**History:** The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of COPD and smoking. He presents with a 1-week history of chest pain and shortness of breath.\n\n**Imaging Findings:** The MRI scan shows a large, round mass in the right lung. The mass is hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. There is surrounding edema and atelectasis.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Lung cancer\n\n**Treatment:** The patient will undergo surgery to remove the tumor.\n\n**Prognosis:** The prognosis for this patient depends on the stage of the lung cancer.",
    "data/glioma/Te-gl_0015.jpg": " **Case 1**\n\n* **Patient:** A 55-year-old female with a history of hypertension and diabetes.\n* **Chief Complaint:** The patient presents with a 2-week history of progressive headaches and nausea. She has also noticed some difficulty with her vision.\n* **MRI Findings:** The MRI scan shows a large mass in the right frontal lobe of the brain. The mass is hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. It is surrounded by a rim of edema.\n* **Diagnosis:** The patient is diagnosed with a glioblastoma. This is a type of primary brain tumor that is characterized by its rapid growth and invasiveness.\n* **Treatment:** The patient is started on a course of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. She is also given steroids to help reduce the swelling in her brain.\n* **Prognosis:** The prognosis for glioblastoma is poor. The average survival time is 12-18 months. However, some patients with glioblastoma may live for longer periods of time.\n\n**Case 2**\n\n* **Patient:** A 35-year-old male with a history of seizures.\n* **Chief Complaint:** The patient presents with a 2-day history of increased seizure activity. He has also been experiencing some difficulty with his speech and memory.\n* **MRI Findings:** The MRI scan shows a small mass in the left temporal lobe of the brain. The mass is isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. It is surrounded by a rim of edema.\n* **Diagnosis:** The patient is diagnosed with a meningioma. This is a type of brain tumor that arises from the meninges, which are the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Meningiomas are usually benign, but they can sometimes cause problems if they grow too large.\n* **Treatment:** The patient is scheduled for surgery to remove the meningioma.\n* **Prognosis:** The prognosis for meningioma is generally good. Most patients who undergo surgery to remove a meningioma are able to make a full recovery.\n\n**Case 3**\n\n* **Patient:** A 25-year-old female with a history of migraines.\n* **Chief Complaint:** The patient presents with a 1-week history of severe headaches. She has also been experiencing some nausea and vomiting.\n* **MRI Findings:** The MRI scan shows a small area of infarction in the right parietal lobe of the brain. The infarction is hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images.\n* **Diagnosis:** The patient is diagnosed with a cerebral infarction. This is a type of stroke that is caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. Infarctions can be caused by a variety of factors, including blood clots, emboli, and vasospasm.\n* **Treatment:** The patient is given aspirin and Plavix to help prevent further blood clots. She is also given fluids and pain medication.\n* **Prognosis:** The prognosis for cerebral infarction depends on the size and location of the infarction. The patient is likely to make a full recovery, but she may have some residual deficits, such as difficulty with speech or movement."
